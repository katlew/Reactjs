* Stateless functional components typically focus on UI
* state should be managed by higher-level "container components" or via Flux/Redux
* they do not support state or lifecycle methods

Benefits
1. No class overhead
1. Don't have to worry about `this` keyword
1. Easy to write & understand
1. Don't have to worry about managing state values
1. Perf improvement

**Summary: ** If you are writing a React component that doesn't require state and would like to create a reusable UI, instead of creating a standard React Component you can write it as a **stateless functional component**
