# Testing Recipes

* Common testing patterns for React components.

> Note:

* This page assumes you’re using Jest as a test runner. If you use a different test runner, you may need to adjust the API, but the overall shape of the solution will likely be the same. Read more details on setting up a testing environment on the Testing Environments page.

* On this page, we will primarily use function components. However, these testing strategies don’t depend on implementation details, and work just as well for class components too.
