# Reconciliation

* React provides a declarative API so that you don’t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update. This makes writing applications a lot easier, but it might not be obvious how this is implemented within React. This article explains the choices we made in React’s “diffing” algorithm so that component updates are predictable while being fast enough for high-performance apps.

## Motivation

When you use React, at a single point in time you can think of the `render()` function as creating a tree of React elements. On the next state or props update, that `render()` function will return a different tree of React elements. React then needs to figure out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree.

There are some generic solutions to this algorithmic problem of generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the state of the art algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n^3) where n is the number of elements in the tree.

If we used this in React, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:

1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
1. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

## The Diffing Algorithm

When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements.

### Elements Of Different Types

Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. Going from `<a>` to `<img>`, or from `<Article>` to `<Comment>`, or from `<Button>` to `<div>` - any of those will lead to a full rebuild.

When tearing down a tree, old DOM nodes are destroyed. Component instances receive `componentWillUnmount()`. When building up a new tree, new DOM nodes are inserted into the DOM. Component instances receive `componentWillMount()` and then `componentDidMount()`. Any state associated with the old tree is lost.

Any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed. For example, when diffing:

```ts
<div>
    <Counter />
</div>

<span>
    <Counter />
</span>
```

* This will destroy the old `Counter` and remount a new one.

### DOM Elements Of The Same Type

When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. For example:

```ts
<div className="before" title="stuff" />

<div className="after" title="stuff" />
```

By comparing these two elements, React knows to only modify the `className` on the underlying DOM node.

When updating `style`, React also knows to update only the properties that changed. For example:

```ts
<div style={{color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold'}} />

<div style={{color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold'}} />
```

* When converting between these two elements, React knows to only modify the color style, not the `fontWeight`.

* After handling the DOM node, React then recurses on the children.

### Component Elements Of The Same Type

When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. 

* React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls `componentWillReceiveProps()` and `componentWillUpdate()` on the underlying instance.
* Next, the `render()` method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.

### Recursing On Children

By default, when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference.

For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well:

```ts
<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ul>
```

React will match the two `<li>first</li>` trees, match the two `<li>second</li>` trees, and then insert the `<li>third</li>` tree.

If you implement it naively, inserting an element at the beginning has worse performance. For example, converting between these two trees works poorly:

```ts
<ul>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Connecticut</li>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
```

React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the `<li>Duke</li>` and `<li>Villanova</li>` subtrees intact. This inefficiency can be a problem.
