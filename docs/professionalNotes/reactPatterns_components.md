# Components

React.Component encapsulates State and Lifecycle.

There are few types o the components available in React:

- Class Component - the component which extends React.Component and uses OOP paradigms to handle state, properties, actions and manage component lifecycle. React component re-renders if the parent component got re-rendered even if no props were changed.
- Pure Component - the React.PureComponent is similar to the React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesnâ€™t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison.

* Function Component - the React.FunctionComponent is the component which takes props and renders them based on internal component logic.
* Method Component - the Method Component is the component which is defined as a method of class or as a function.

## Regular components no props change

If there is no any additional work on the child components done the Class and Function children components will re-render even if no properties have been changed.

As Pure component implements shallow comparison of the props out of the box, it won't re-render.
