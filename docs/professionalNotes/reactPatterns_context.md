# Context

This page covers only modern React Context API, i.e. `createContext()`.

## Context behavior

All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers (including .contextType on class components and useContext() hook) is not subject to the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method or `React.memo()`, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component skips an update.

```ts
// ðŸ’¡ React.memo will ignored
const Example = React.memo((props) => {
  // ðŸ’£ Updates will be triggered inside
  const value = React.useContext(Context);

  return <div />;
});
```

> Examples and info is taken from the official ReactJS documentation.

Context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a providerâ€™s parent re-renders. For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value:

```ts
class Example extends React.Component {
  state = { value: 1 };
  render() {
    const { children } = this.props;

    // â›” ({ value: 1 } === { value: 1 }) is false, so reference is different
    return <Provider value={{ value: this.state.value }}>{children}</Provider>;
  }
}
```

To get around this, lift the value into the parentâ€™s state:

```ts
class Example extends React.Component {
  state = { value: 1 };
  render() {
    const { children } = this.props;

    return <Provider value={this.state.value}>{children}</Provider>;
  }
}
```

> Note: if context value is constant, then having a static value is fine, no even need to use useMemo().
